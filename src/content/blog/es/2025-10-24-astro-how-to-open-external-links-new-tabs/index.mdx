## Introduction

When developing a website, if you care about user retention, it's important to open most external links in new tabs, so that the user can easily go back to your website.

Think a business brand, if they have a link to another website like a guide or a partner, when the user clicks it, they will lose track of your website, while if it opens in a new tab, then the user will have your website present in their tabs.

Now, you probably know that you can easily do that by writing `target="_blank"` in any `<a>` link. The problem arises when some of your pages are posted using markdown code, where links are written like this: `[My link](https://example.com)`.

<WebsiteDesignCTA client:visible />

## The crappy solution

You can, of course, write HTML directly in your Astro markdown files, so in theory you can just do:

```markdown
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">
  My link
</a>
```

And that will 100% work, but it's such **A PAIN** in the 🍑:

1. Having to write this for every single link
2. If the link is at the end of the parragraph and you have Prettier or other markdown formatting tools, it will put the link in a new line.

**Horrible stuff.**

## The super cool solution (Wooo!)

1. You just write normal markdown links
2. Astro will add the `targer=_blank` automatically to any external links

How do we do this? Easy: 🌈**javascript**🌈

### Step 1: Install `rehype-external-links`

You thought we would code this ourselves? **Hell no**.

Rehype has a super useful library for this that get's any external links on your site and adds `rel` and `target` attributes to them automatically.

Start by installing it:

```
npm install rehype-external-links
```

### Step 2: Configure it in your Astro configure

Open `astro.config.mjs` and add the plugin like so:

```js
// ...
import rehypeExternalLinks from 'rehype-external-links';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    // ...
    markdown({
      rehypePlugins: [[rehypeExternalLinks, { target: '_blank', rel: [] }]],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Note that if you also want this to work on `.mdx` files you need to specify it as well:

```js
// ...
import rehypeExternalLinks from 'rehype-external-links';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    // ...
    markdown({
      rehypePlugins: [[rehypeExternalLinks, { target: '_blank', rel: [] }]],
    }),
    mdx({
      rehypePlugins: [[rehypeExternalLinks, { target: '_blank', rel: [] }]],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### That's it!

Easy right? Now any external link in your markdown files will have the target blank attribute!

## More external link customizations

Astro docs has [a cool guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/external-links/) on how to add icons to any external links in your markdown files.

The set up is super similar:

```js
// ...
import rehypeExternalLinks from 'rehype-external-links';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypeExternalLinks,
        {
          content: { type: 'text', value: ' 🔗' },
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
});
```
