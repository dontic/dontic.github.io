import Waitlist from '../../../components/common/waitlist.tsx';

I've been building production ready apps for many years now. And I've been publishing technical articles throughout the process.

Many people have reached out and asked me if I would mind doing some tutorial on how to build and deploy a full stack app from scratch.

I'm still polishing the details but I've began to write all the documentation for it.

This will take considerable time to do, so in the meantime you can join the waitlist and I will notify you when I release the course:

<Waitlist client:visible />
