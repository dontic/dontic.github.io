import Waitlist from '../../../components/common/waitlist.tsx';

I've been building production ready apps for many years now. And I've been publishing technical articles throughout the process.

Many people, especially those who want to build some kind of SaaS or side project, have reached out and asked me if I would mind doing some tutorial on how to build and deploy a full stack app from scratch.

**The course will include:**

- GIT basics and strategy
- Building a REST API backend with Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL
- Background tasks with Celery workers and Redis
- Authentication and Authorization
- Building a React frontend with Vite and Chakra UI
- Deploying with Docker to any cloud provider you want
- CI/CD with Github Actions
- Monitoring your app with Loki and Grafana
- Creating a landing page with Astro
- SEO best practices
- Payment processing with Stripe

I'm still polishing the details but I've began to write all the documentation for it.

This will take considerable time to do, so in the meantime you can join the waitlist and I will notify you when I release the course:

<Waitlist client:visible />

If there's anything you'd like to see in the course, hit me up on [X](https://x.com/onticdani).
