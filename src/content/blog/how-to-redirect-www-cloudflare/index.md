## Introduction

I've read countless tutorials and watched many YouTube videos until I found the correct way to implement a www redirect in Cloudflare.

When you have a website, you may want to redirect the www version of your domain to the non-www version. This is important for SEO, since search engines prefer a single source, and to avoid duplicate content issues. In this article, we will show you how to properly redirect www to non-www with Cloudflare.

## Step by step

1. Login to Cloudflare
2. Go to the domain you want to set up the redirect
3. Go to "DNS" > "Records" and remove any `www` record that you have
4. Now add a new `A` record with the name `www` and the IPv4 address `192.0.2.1` (this is the step that everyone is missing)
5. Make sure to leave the "Proxied" option on
6. Go to "Rules" > "Redirect Rules"
7. Hit "+ Create Rule"
8. Under "Create new Single Redirect" there is a "Redirect from WWW to Root" snippet. Click on "Create a Rule" in that snippet
9. Change the Rule name if you want and hit "Deploy"

That's it! You have successfully redirected www to non-www with Cloudflare.

> **IMPORTANT!** You might see that these rules aren't working in your browser. This is because the browser caches the redirects so it might take a while for your browser to update.
>
> To make sure that it's working:
>
> 1. Try it from a different browser/laptop/phone
> 2. Use this command: `curl -I https://www.example.com` and you should see a `301 Moved Permanently` and a `location:...` with the destination of the redirect in the response

## Why do we need a DNS record for www pointing to a random IP address?

`192.0.2.1` is just a dummy IP address, you could literally use any IP address you want.

This particular address is commonly used in local networks so, as a public IP, it won't really go anywhere.

The reason we need to add this record is because Cloudflare needs to have a record for the `www` subdomain in order to create the redirect rule. Otherwise it will give a `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` error as the 'Internet' will think that there is nothing matching that DNS record (www.example.com).

## Manually adding the redirect rule

If you prefer to manually add the redirect rule, you can do so by creating a new rule under "Rules" > "Redirect Rules" and filling in the following fields:

- **If incoming requests match...** - Select "Wildcard pattern"
- **Request URL**: `https://www.*`
- **Target URL**: `https://${1}`
- **Status Code**: `301`

What this does is get the asterisks part of www request and use it in the target URL. This way, if someone goes to `www.example.com`, they will be redirected to `example.com`.

## Why do I get a `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` error?

If you get this error, it means that there is no DNS record for the `www` subdomain.

Make sure you have added the `A` record with the name `www` and a dummy IP address like `192.0.1.2` (See step 4 of the guide above).
