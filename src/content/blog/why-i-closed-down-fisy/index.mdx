When I [left my job at Tesla in 2023](/about), I had a clear vision of what I wanted to do. In fact, I had been working on a project on weekends and I was burning out, which was when I made the decision to dedicate all my time to it.

I had a clear vision of what I wanted to build: a tool that would help people save time. It came from my own physiotherapist, who said she couldn't find a single tool in the market that did all that she needed.

## Wrong approach, wrong approach!

I immediately started to work on the product, without validation, without asking my physiotherapist for feedback and with 1567 features that I thought would be useful.

I think of this now and I laugh. It's the clich√© mistake every single entrepreneur makes. Ignore the world and just build something you think is cool or great.

I spent 5 months building this, full time, without releasing anything, without getting feedback... I was just building what I thought was cool.

## The opportunity

During the development of Fisy, I got approached by a guy who wanted to build something with me, but something new and different than Fisy. The guy seemed a great person, [I wish I knew better](/blog/lessons-learned-on-choosing-a-cofounder/), but that's a story for another time.

At the time I didn't know [how to say no](#) so I agreed to build something new with him, assuming I will be able to finish Fisy by december and that it would run on autopilot.

Well, december came and I started going out to pitch the product. Guess what?

Nobody was interested. Like, nobody.

## The decision

I didn't understand what the niche needed, and I didn't know how to market it. Clock was ticking and I had to decide, I already commited to this cofounder so I stuck to my word and parked Fisy so I could focus on the new project.

## Conclusion

All of this to say what everyone says:

1. Do not start building something before you validate it
2. Do your market research
3. Learn how to marked and distribute your product
