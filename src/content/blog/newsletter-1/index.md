Hey there!

If your first thought is "wait, what is this, who are you" 🤔, I should apologize as it has taken me A LONG WHILE to get started with this newsletter, so let me introduce myself again:

Hi, I'm Daniel, I'm an entrepreneur based in Madrid, Spain. I have been wanting to start a newsletter for years, that's why I put some shiny forms in my website a month ago, which you, graceful stranger (hopefully not for long), valiantly submitted your email in.

This is the first issue of this newsletter, so I will be fairly quick and will just set some things straight:

- These will be sent from my personal email, no branding BS, you can reply at anytime to this address. There are a fair lot of you already and I have a company to take care of, so please excuse me if I do not reply, though I promise I will do my best 😅.
- The goal of this newsletter is to provide value to you. One of the things that drive me the most in life is creating value, that's why I'm an entrepreneur, why I started my blog and this newsletter.
- There will be no AI in this newsletter. Part of why I wanted to do this is to force myself to get creative constantly. We'll talk about creativity a lot here. I won't even be putting these through ChatGPT to "improve quality pls".
- English is not my first language, so please excuse me if there are some errors then and there.
- I will be trying to send an issue every weekend, but do expect radio silence some weekends. If I learned something in life is to begin taking "baby steps", we will be talking about this as well. And I was afraid I wouldn't have things to talk about 😆.

**What will these be about?**

I don't plan to use them to send tech tutorials, I have my tech blog for that, but rather about lessons in life in business, from productivity and business tips, to mental health to guides on how to (mostly "not") do things.

They will also be about whatever you want them to be about, again, my goal is to provide value, so feel free to reply to this email or send me a tweet @onticdani on X if you have any comments on the above.

Enjoy the rest of the week! Until next one,

Daniel xx
