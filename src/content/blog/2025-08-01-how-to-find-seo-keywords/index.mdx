## Introduction

I recently launched [AutoIPC](https://autoipc.es), it's a small tool I needed for one of my real estate companies, to automate some process regarding tenants. Since I had to build it anyways, I figured someone else might have a use for it as well and created a quick landing page for it. Took me 2 afternoons.

Anyways, my strategy was to validate the idea fast by ranking with Google Ads on some specific keywords, but... what keywords?

If you ever had that same question, this is the article for you.

## Step 1 - Create a massive list of initial keywords

So the first step you need to do is create a big (and I mean **BIG**) list of keyphrases for your site.

"But Daniel, how am I supposed to come up with these?" - you say

Don't worry, little grashopper, I'm here to lead the way. Just start by asking yourself:

- What problem is my service/product solving? -> How would I look for guides like this on the internet?
- What is my target audience? -> What would they look for on a daily basis on Google?

So for instance, if I made a light for small children's bedrooms, and I put myself in the mind of the parent, I would search for stuff like:

- Children bedroom night lamp
- Cute baby night light
- Is it safe for my child to sleep with a light on?
- Does light affect sleep in children?
- ...

You get the gist of it. Now do the same with your stuff and come up with **at least** 10 phrases. Don't worry if you don't get all of them, you can always repeat this process whenever you come up with new ideas.

Ok, now type those 10 phrases in [keywordsheeter](https://keywordsheeter.com/) (not a sponsor), it's a free tool that helps you convert those few phrases into hundreds or even thousands of keywords.

Once you have a list of a few hundred, copy all of them and head to the next step.

## Step 2 - Google Keyword Planner

Now you need to go into [Google Keyword Planner](https://business.google.com/ad-tools/keyword-planner/) (also not a sponsor).

1. You will need to create a Google Ads account if you don't have one
2. Once you have the Ads account, head over the [the keyword planner](https://ads.google.com/aw/keywordplanner/home)
3. Start a new analysis on keyword volume
4. Paste all the keywords from the keyword sheeter and hit start
5. Sort the keywords by avg. monthly searches

Boom!

Now you have a list of keywords you need to rank for. You should go for the ones with more search volume, but also take into account the keyword difficulty, which we will talk about in the next step.

## Step 3 - Keyword difficulty and competitors

This is an extra step I always like to do.

1. First, start by selecting one of the keywords you're going to go for.
2. Now head over to [ahrefs' keyword difficulty checker](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-difficulty) (also not sponsored, please someone sponsor me), and paste that keyword.

Ahrefs will give you the difficulty of that keyword in a more precise way than Google does. Not only that, but it will tell you your biggest competitors (SEO-wise, that is) so you can also check them out and see what content they are generating to rank for, which will feed your keyword idea loop and bring you to step 1 again.

## Step 4 - Repeat, repeat, repeat

Now it's just a matter of writing content for those keywords and getting backlinks. The only thing left for me to do here is to wish you luck!
