## Introduction

I've previously written [how to squash migrations in django](https://daniel.es/blog/django-how-to-squash-migrations/), which is the propper way to consolidate several migrations into one file.

But recently, I've found myself in an edge case:

I started a new project, so my migrations were all over the place, I ran 10 `makemigrations` commands in like 40 minutes. I am far from deploying, but I already have some useful data in my dev database for testing purposes that I want to preserve.

So I have 2 solutions for this:

1. [Squash the migrations](https://daniel.es/blog/django-how-to-squash-migrations/):

   - **Pros**: Preserve the existing database data
   - **Cons**: Create _a lot_ of unnecessary database operations and have an overcomplicated migration file (i.e.: I create a model but then I forgot to put decimal constraints on a certain field, that's 2 operations instead of just 1)

2. Run `django manage.py migrate myapp zero` to remove all the migrations from the database, and re-run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`

   - **Pros**: Have a clean migration file
   - **Cons**: Lose all the database data

So I wondered:

> Isn't there a way we can have the best of both worlds?

Turns out... **we can**!

## Fake reverting migrations in django

The trick is to fake revert the migrations, instead of reverting them for real.

Here's how to do it:

1. Run `python manage.py migrate myapp zero --fake`

   The `--fake` flag will tell django to mark the migration as not applied in the `django_migrations` table, but **without modifying the data** in the database.

2. Delete the migration files (remove all the migration files you want to consolidate into just one)

3. Create new migration files `python manage.py makemigrations myapp`

4. Fake apply the new migration: `python manage.py migrate autoipc --fake`

   This marks the migration as applied without actually applying it in the database.

That's it! You should have a super clean migration file without having lost the data.

This flow is **SUPER useful** during the development phase of django models.

## Words of caution

- **ALWAYS** back up your data first, you never know what can go wrong.
- **ONLY** do this in isolated git branches when developing new django features. If you do this in prod you will most probably break something.
- **ONLY** do this if the models match the database schema. If you modify anything in the models in between this process, or have pending migrations, you will break everything.
