## Introduction

If you're like me and love [building modern sites with Astro](https://daniel.es/website-design/) you probably encountered the `trailingSlash` dilemma and wondered why is such a big deal and if you should go with or without it for your site.

We'll solve all of these questions and see my preferred way of implementing it.

## What the hell is trailing slash?

Quite elemental my dear Watson.

It's how you want your Astro routes to end, with or without a `/`

- Trailig slash **yes** : `/about/`
- Traling slash **no**: `/about`

## Why even care?

This is important mainly for SEO purposes.

Having 2 existing routes for the same content, i.e.: `/about` and `/about/`, can be confusing and search engines like Google might interpret it as **duplicated content** and penalize you for it.

So it's always good practice to decide on one for your whole project and create 301 redirect rules for the other, let me explain:

1. You chose to have your routes _without_ a trailing slash: `/about`. This is where your real content will live.
2. You create a redirect rule from `/about/` -> `/about`

This signals that you serve your content in `/about/` and anyone trying to go to `/about` will be redirected to it.

## Why the redirects?

Well, you can't trust everyone linking to your website to get it right all the time, and you don't want people to meet your `404` page!

ThankfulLy Astro does all this work for us automatically, let's see how.

## My preferred Astro config

Let's go through this in small steps:

1. Decide on what you prefer, trailing slash or no traling slash, there is no right answer, this comes from what your OCD brain likes better.

   I went _with_ trailing slash cause I like `/about/` more than `/about`, sue me.

   For \*reasons\*, I will asume you did the same so we can keep this guide homogenous.

2. Now set the `trailingSlash` config in `astro.config.mjs` like this:

```js
// ...
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  trailingSlash: 'always', // or 'never' if you went without tralingSlash
});
```

Tha's it!

This config does the following:

1. In production, it will create automatic 301 redirects from routes without trailing slashes to the ones with trailing slashies, i.e.: `/about` -> `301` -> `/about/`. This, in case anyone \*dares\* to link to your site without a trailing slash.

2. In development mode you will get an error page if you end up in a page _without_ a trailing slash. This way you know you need to fix those links and prevent having an extra redirect in production.

## Conclusion

Apart from learning that _with_ tralingSlash is the way to go, you know have the necessary concepts of how this works and why it exsists:

- Avoid duplicating routes with the same content
- Implement automatic 301 redirects
- Trailing slashes are Conclusion

Catch you on the next one!
