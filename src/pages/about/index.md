Hey! Thank's for stopping by!

As a passionate engineer, I've always been cusrious about how things work and creating things using that knowledge.

I've worked at companies like [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) and [Correos](https://www.correos.es/) and have been a consultant for startups, always helping build projects that relate to data and automation.

Now I'm a full time entrepreneur, working on several [projects](/projects/) with the aim to help companies and people automate tasks and save time.

This is my little corner of the internet where [I share my learnings and thoughts](/blog/), both technical and business related, from all my past and current experiences.

Feel free to reach out on [X](https://x.com/onticdani) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsdaniel/).

## Founder: GearShift | 2024 - Present

After the fall of my previous startup, I started doing some consulting work for other startups. But this wasn't it, I still craved creating my own stuff. So I founded [GearShift](https://gearshift.es/), a holding company to launch all the [projects](/projects/) in my head.

## Founder: Emilio | 2023 - 2024

After leaving Tesla, I focused a couple of months on learning propper full stack development. Mainly with django and react.

Then I got aproached by a high ranking executive to build a startup. We brainstormed for a couple of months and decided to jump on the AI train and build a virtual AI assistant for gmail. We got traction after another couple of months, after which things went south.

This venture [didn't end well](/blog/lessons-learned-on-choosing-a-cofounder/), but it tought me a lot about entrepreneurship and business, and it made clear what path I wanted to follow.

## Quality Engineer: Tesla | 2020 - 2023

When Covid hit, I started feeling unmotivated and wanted to start pursuing my passions. I've always loved cars and technology, thus I loved Tesla. Low and behold, I landed a job at Tesla as a Field Support Engineer in Oslo, Norway.

We worked closely with the design and service teams to improve the fleet, this is where my data and automation skills came in handy, I started doing some cool research with the global field data to improve the cars at the Berlin Gigafactory.

When I wasn't analysing data on my laptop, I was out in the field testing and collecting telemetry data myself. We did this in the most extreme places on earth, from the arctic circle in Norway in winter to the middle of the desert in Dubai in the summer:

Then I discovered the magic of web apps when I got asked to build a tool that matched the right battery part numbers with a certain vehicle. This was a really fun project and I learned a lot about web development.

## Data Analyst: Correos | 2020

While on my last year at uni I landed an internship at Correos, the national logistics company in Spain. I quickly became the "data guy" after someone asked me to manually update daily an excell with what felt a thousand columns (classic intern job!). I automated the whole process in Python, VBR and Power BI, and what previously took them a full day my computer did in 5 minutes.

It was here where I also picked up data analysis with R and SQL (and fell in love with it). After which I discovered the amazing world of Python and Pandas. Since they dindn't have a data engineer, I got suddenly flooded with a lot of responsibility of analysing field logistics data and providing a weekly update to the quality guys.

## My love for engineering and coding

My passion for engineering appeared early. Since I was a little kid I've always been disassembling and modifying electronics (sorry Mom). I would always have some sort of project going on at home.

Computers were also a big part of my life. Remember that little kid teachers would call to fix the computer? That was me.

I then started coding in Python, and to this day it's still my favorite language. I also dabbled in C, arduinos, and what not. Then I started building more complex apps, python bots, sql, data dashboards...

I also started building my own homelab to host my services and store all my data. It's a really fun experience using hypervisors, learning networking and coding your own services!
