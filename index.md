# Hey, I am Daniel
# Electro-mechanical engineer
# based in Madrid, Spain.

Building useful tools is what I enjoy most. Both at work and home, I love developing and automating processes as well as data analytics.

Iâ€™m [tweeting](https://twitter.com/onticdani), [taking photos](https://vero.co/onticdani) and [writing articles](https://daniel.es/blog) about coding and life in general.

For collaboration or questions shoot me a message on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/gsdaniel)!
